# surfs_up

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to determine the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round

### Purpose
###### Determine the Summary Statistics for June
###### Determine the Summary Statistics for December

## Results: 
### A: Deliverable 1: Summary Statistics for June
#### 1: Oahu observes higher mean temperature in June of 74.9 
#### 2: 75% percentile recorded temperature of 77
#### 3: Even minimum temperature recorded was 64

## Summary
#### Summary of results: Although maximum temperature recorded in Oahu was almost similar (85 & 83) in June and December, June was generally hotter with mean of 74.9 versus 71 in December. Moreover 75% percentile recorded temperature was also higher in June. This clearly signifies that although the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, June is better month for the sustainability of the business

#### Two additional queries to get more results
##### 1. We can even use Regression Analysis along with the use of plot (Matplotlib) functions to visualise the resulst
##### 2. Box plots can also be used to identify the outliers
